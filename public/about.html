<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Luli, currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science, where my passion for problem-solving and innovation thrives. I’ve always been someone who enjoys stepping out of my comfort zone, whether it’s trying new things, diving into thought-provoking conversations, or simply exploring the unknown. I believe that life is a continuous process of self-discovery, and I am constantly reflecting on my path, even if it means occasionally feeling lost or uncertain.</p>
<p>I view these moments of doubt not as setbacks, but as opportunities to learn and grow. My curiosity drives me to question and understand the world from multiple angles, both in my academic pursuits and in how I navigate life. I aim to live fully, embracing every experience with a sense of adventure and purpose, knowing that the ups and downs are what make life meaningful. Through it all, I seek balance, growth, and most importantly, to stay true to myself.</p>
